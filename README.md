*PROTOTYPE*
Taskly is a lightweight, browser-based scheduling and billing tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, vibe-coded with the complete assistance from AI tools like Gemini and ChatGPT.

Designed to simplify day-to-day operations for small businesses and freelancers, Taskly uses a guided question flow to capture essential client and appointment details â€” payment range, client size, preferred time slot, multiple-day bookings, assistant details,advance payment ( if yes, how much?) and location.

All appointment data is securely stored in some kind of combination of local storage and Firebase, enabling real-time saving. Once logged, appointments are displayed in a clean calendar view for quick reference.

Taskly also features a bill generator that creates professional invoices and sends them directly via WhatsApp, removing the need for separate billing apps. With its responsive design, no complex setup, and cloud-powered storage, Taskly is ideal for solo entrepreneurs, home businesses, and anyone looking for simple yet effective appointment management.
Note: The appointment-saving functionality is currently under review ( confusion) . While the app includes logic for saving data, its actual storage behavior may vary depending on configuration. Please review and adjust the storage setup before using in production.
